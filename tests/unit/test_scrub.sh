# Unit Test: the runner's address never leaves a test's output (no Docker)
# A game learns the lab's public address from Steam and prints it; on lab
# hardware the workflow masks that address in the job log and fails a suite
# that prints it. These helpers are what let a test dump a container's log
# without doing that, and this is the test that keeps them - and every dump in
# tests/e2e - honest.
